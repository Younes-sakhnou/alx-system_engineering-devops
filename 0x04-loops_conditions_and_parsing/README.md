This short readme provides a quick overview of creating SSH keys and basic Bash scripting concepts.

1. Creating SSH Keys

Follow these steps to create SSH keys:
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Generate the key pair using ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com".
Choose a passphrase for added security (optional).
Copy the public key to the remote server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
2. Advantage of #!/usr/bin/env bash

Using #!/usr/bin/env bash as the shebang in Bash scripts is preferred over #!/bin/bash.
It allows the system to locate the bash interpreter in the user's PATH, providing better portability across different environments.
3. Loops in Bash

Bash supports three types of loops: while, until, and for.
Use while to execute a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true.
Use until to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition becomes true.
Use for to iterate over a list of items and execute code for each item.
4. Condition Statements in Bash

Bash supports conditional branching using if, else, elif, and case statements.
Use if-else to execute different code blocks based on a condition.
Use elif to check additional conditions after the initial if statement.
Use case to match a variable against patterns and execute code for the first matching pattern.
5. Using the Cut Command

The cut command is used to extract specific columns or character ranges from text files.
Use -f option to specify columns and -d to set custom delimiters.
Use -c option for character-based extraction and -b for byte-based extraction.
6. File Comparison Operators

Bash provides operators for comparing files and other values.
Common file comparison operators include -e (file exists), -f (is a regular file), -d (is a directory), and more.
Other comparison operators are -eq (equal), -ne (not equal), -lt (less than), -gt (greater than), etc.
