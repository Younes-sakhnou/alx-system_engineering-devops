# Localhost, IP Addresses, and Network Interfaces

This readme provides a brief explanation of the following topics:

1. **What is localhost/127.0.0.1?**
   - "localhost" is a special hostname that refers to the current device itself. It is used to access services or applications running on the same machine.
   - "127.0.0.1" is the IP address associated with "localhost," allowing applications to communicate with themselves without going over the network.

2. **What is 0.0.0.0?**
   - "0.0.0.0" is a special IP address that represents all IP addresses on the local machine. It is used as a placeholder to listen on all available network interfaces or to specify "any" address.

3. **What is /etc/hosts?**
   - "/etc/hosts" is a plain text file on Unix-like operating systems that maps domain names to IP addresses. It allows users to define local mappings before DNS resolution.

4. **How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces?**
   - To display active network interfaces, use the command "ifconfig" on Linux or macOS. On Windows, use the command "ipconfig" in the command prompt.

This readme provides a basic understanding of these concepts, making it easier to work with network configurations and local services on your machine.
